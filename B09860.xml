            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS that Milled-Sheet-Lead is Better <hi>and Cheaper than</hi> Cast-Sheet-Lead <hi>for all Æ²ses whatsoever.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Milled Lead pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be better than Cast Lead.</note>1. THE thickness of the Plumbers most usual Covering for Buildings hath of late been of a Size, pretended to be 8 or 9 <hi>l.</hi> to the Foot-square, sometimes 7 <hi>l.</hi> though formerly from 10 to 12, was the usual thickness; pretended is said, because truly so, it never was, nor can be, being Cast upon a Superficial Plain of Sand, made, smoothed, and strook by Hand, always subject to Errour, more or less, according to the skill and care of the Workman.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Inequality is of great moment to the goodness of the Covering; (though it be not much regarded, if the Square-measure come near the Size desired in the weight of the whole Sheet:) For if the Sun be the cause of the drawing, cockling, and cracking of a Lead-Covering, (as some think they alledge with great disadvantage to the Milled Lead) then the Beams thereof falling with equal force upon an unequal Body, must necessarily draw the weaker or thinner parts more than the stronger, and consequently be one chief cause of the Cast-Lead-Coverings more early decay, though there are many more Causes that contribute to it, which the Milled Lead is not liable to, <hi>viz.</hi> Its Roughness, Sand-holes, and Blow-holes, which are contracted in the Body of the Lead in Casting, and not discoverable to the Customer, as not appearing in the Superficies thereof, but the Mill discovering the same in working, these faults cannot pass in a Milled Sheet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So that although these defects are (some or all) constant in Cast-Lead, yet if the Cast-sheet could be made exactly equal to the thinnest part thereof, it must be granted a more durable and better Covering, than that which is thicker in one place than in another. And that all Cast-Lead is more or less so, none will deny. But how great this Inequality is, is left to the Inspection and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of indifferent Men, who will rarely meet with a Sheet of Cast-Lead, that (the Burr on the Edge being cut off, or any one part of the Sheet cut and compared with some other part of the same Sheet) is not apparently unequal, when as a Pound or two in a Foot-Square is hardly discernable by the Eye in the Sizes abovementioned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wherefore Milled Lead being exactly even, and of a Size equal to the thinnest part of Cast-Lead, must be allowed to be a better Covering in that respect only, though there are many other Advantages in Milled Lead in respect of its Solidity, Smoothness, Beauty, Lightness of Covering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this Lead being first Cast above 40 <hi>l.</hi> to the Foot, and drawn down to the several sizes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers all Blow-holes and other faults in Casting when they happen, and must render the Milled Lead sound and more solid, as well as smooth and equal.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">Milled Lead pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be cheaper than Cast Lead.</note>5. As the Milled Lead is thus proved to be a better Covering, so is it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively much a cheaper, though the Companies Rates were higher than they are, as may appear upon Inspection of the Table, calculated to avoid the trouble of Computation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Present Prices. Per Hund.</hi> The thicker sort from 5 <hi>l.</hi> upwards atâ16 <hi>s.</hi> Middle sort from 5 <hi>l.</hi> to near 3. atâ17 <hi>s.</hi> Thinner sort from about 3 <hi>l.</hi> and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der atâ18 <hi>s.</hi> But at the <hi>Stilyard</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> more for smaller quantities.</note> and the uncertain Guesses Men usually make in matters of this kind. For it being evident that Milled Lead which is more Solid, Smooth as Glass, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly equal, must be better than Cast Lead, some certain and undeniable degree, how much it is better, with regard to price goodness and plain, the same quantity will cover, ought to be agreed to for Computation sake; and if the least dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Sizes, that can be granted, be in favour of the Milled Lead, at the Price the Company sells it, every Man is left to his own reason to consider from this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how much a greater disproportion may reasonably be admitted, than that which makes the present Prices equal. For Example: Let us suppose Milled Lead of 6 <hi>l.</hi> to the Foot, to be but as good as Cast Lead of 8 <hi>l.</hi> (Though 9 <hi>l.</hi> may very well be admitted by any one that will but impartially observe the great inequality of Cast Lead Coverings, which he will often find to be much above a third part thinner in one place than in another.) Then by the Table, if the Plumbers Price be 14 <hi>s. per</hi> Hund. the Milled Lead ought to be 18 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Hund. If 13 <hi>s.</hi> the Milled Lead should be 17 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> and if but 12 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> the Milled Lead ought yet to be 16 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Hund. which if Sold for 16 <hi>s.</hi> it is plain enough that Milled Lead is cheaper than Cast Lead, which was to be proved.</p>

               <p n="2">2. That the thinner sort of Milled Lead is of excellent Use, and cheap to line Brewers Backs, Milk-Trays, Coffins, Wooden Cisterns, or Boxes for the Preservation of divers sorts of Goods for Foreign Voyages, as Corn, Meal, Gunpowder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which was Experimented by the late Earl of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> when he went Governour of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the Corn and Meal being preserved Sweet in those Boxes, which afterwards served him for Cisterns, whilst the same sort in Cask was Musty, and the Gunpowder of a Sixth part more force upon Tryal, than the same sort carried in Barrels, as was certified by his Lordship, Sir <hi>Henry Morgan</hi> and others. Also for lining of Walls for the preservation of Hangings and Pictures, from the damage they receive by moisture and Salt Peter therein, or for Painting thereon, or on Signs or Sign Posts covered therewith. Also this thin Lead laid upon a thin Coat of Clay, and covered with the same, will secure vaults under Streets, Yards, or Gardens very Cheap and Tight against Rain or Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </label> after all former Objections, (as to Dearness, Sailing, Fouling, and Difficulty in Cleansing Galling by Cables, and Rubbing off on Ground) were fully answered to the advantage of the Lead-Sheathing, and His late Majesties full Approbation, as well in respect of Cheapness as the Effectual Preservation of His Ships against the Worm, declared by Himself at the Admiralty Board, and by the then Lords of the Admiralty signified by their Letter to the then Commissioners of the Navy, with direction to Sheath no otherwise for the future, without express order from that Board. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>
                  </label> But how Groundless this last complaint hath been too plainly appears to be disputed: For if Lead-Sheathing be the cause of the Rudder-Irons greater decay, then all Ships Sheathed with Lead, to which equal Accidents of time in Voyages, or lying in Salt-Water do happen, must necessarily have their Rudder-Irons decay equally; but it is evident from their own shewing in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances they bring from the Rudder-Irons decay in 8 of the said Ships, that every one differs considerably in the times of decay from other and at several times each one from it self, one lasting sometimes Twice or Thrice as long as another; So that it is very unreasonable to charge Lead-Sheathing which is always the same, to be the Cause of such different effects, but rather to charge the guilt of this different decay upon the different Goodness and Composition of the Iron, difference in Fire, time and labour in Welding, Working, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this being impossible to be equal, it must produce Iron-Work o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> very unequal Goodness, which seems to be the true Cause of such unequal decays; and upon impartial enquiry, this decay in the Iron-Work will appear always to have been common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant in all Ships, whether Sheathed either way, or not Sheathed at all. However, if this charge were true against the Lead-Sheathing, Capping the Bolts (the same as in Wood-Sheathing) but carefully they are preserved, and a new set of Rudder-Irons always in store to shift in any Voyage if there be occasion, will be a very little charge to be mentioned, where so many and so great advantages otherwise accrue.</p>

The Graving which may be saved in the time the Lead-Sheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may lie on, (the which will never need stripping but to repair the Hull) may amount to as much Money as the Sheathing cost at first, and when it shall be stript the Sheathing being Metal will yield its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to Melt down again. But the Wood Sheathing will be great charge in Graving, besides the hazard of Fire in briming, last but a Voyage or two, and when stript is worth little or nothing, Demonstrations plain enough that the Lead-Sheathing with regard to the time it may last, costs nothing in comparison of Wood-Sheathing: Besides there are many other considerable advantages in Lead-Sheathing, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Sheathing being smoother and lying on thinner,<note place="margin">Many other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages by Lead-Sheathing.</note> the Ship must Sail better. 2. By using the long scrubbing Brushes which are provided to keep her clean but once in two or three months as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offers, the Ship may keep longer at Sea, and need not put so often into Harbour as formerly to Grave, Wash and Tallow. 3. The smalness of the Nails no damage to the Plank when stript, whereas the great Nail holes of a Wood-sheathing which requires spyling up, must somewhat weaken the Plank, and render the Ship not so fit for future service without Sheathing. 4. This way of Sheathing being with Materials of the King's own Dominions, can never be wanting; whereas the most essential parts of Wood-sheathing being of Foreign growth, they are many times by reason of Wars not to be had at all, or at Prices much exceeding the ordinary Rates; and the Consumption of our own Product being a publick Benefit, Lead-sheathing ought the rather to be encouraged.</p>
